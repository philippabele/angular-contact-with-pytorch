# Contribution Guide

Hey there! We are really excited that you are interested in contributing. This is a general contribution guide without any particular project or technology stack in mind. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide:

## 🙌 Sending Pull Request

### Discuss First

Before you start to work on a feature pull request, it's always better to open a feature request issue first to discuss with the maintainers whether the feature is desired and the design of those features. This would help save time for both the maintainers and the contributors and help features to be shipped faster.

For typo fixes, it's recommended to batch multiple typo fixes into one pull request to maintain a cleaner commit history.

### Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages, which allows the changelog to be auto-generated based on the commits. Please read the guide through if you aren't familiar with it already.

Only `fix:` and `feat:` will be presented in the changelog.

Note that `fix:` and `feat:` are for **actual code changes** (that might affect logic).
For typo or document changes, use `docs:` or `chore:` instead:

- ~~`fix: typo`~~ -> `docs: fix typo`

### Pull Request

If you don't know how to send a Pull Request, we recommend reading [the guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

When sending a pull request, make sure your PR's title also follows the [Commit Convention](#commit-conventions).

If your PR fixes or resolves an existing issue, please add the following line in your PR description (replace `123` with a real issue number):

```markdown
fix #123
```

This will let GitHub know the issues are linked, and automatically close them once the PR gets merged. Learn more at [the guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).

It's ok to have multiple commits in a single PR, you don't need to rebase or force push for your changes as we will use `Squash and Merge` to squash the commits into one commit when merging.

We do not add any commit hooks to allow for quick commits. But before you make a pull request, you should ensure that any lint/test scripts are passing.

In general, please also make sure that there are no unrelated changes in a PR. For example, if your editor has made any changes to whitespace or formatting elsewhere in a file that you edited, please revert these so it is more obvious what your PR changes. And please avoid including multiple unrelated features or fixes in a single PR. If it is possible to separate them, it is better to have multiple PRs to review and merge separately. In general, a PR should do one thing only.
